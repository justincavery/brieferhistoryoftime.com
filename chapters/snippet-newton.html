  Isaac Newton was not a pleasant man. His relations with other academics were notorious, with most of his later life spent embroiled in heated disputes. Following publication of Principia Mathematica—surely the most influential book ever written in physics— Newton rose rapidly into public prominence. He was appointed president of the Royal Society and became the first scientist ever to be knighted.
