          <p>We find ourselves in a bewildering world. We want to make sense of what we see
          around us and to ask: What is the nature of the universe? What is our place in it, and where did it and
          we come from? Why is it the way it is?</p>


          <p>To try to answer these questions, we adopt some picture of the world. Just as an infinite tower of
          tortoises supporting the flat earth is such a picture, so is the theory of superstrings. Both are theories
          of the universe, though the latter is much more mathematical and precise than the former. Both
          theories lack observational evidence: no one has ever seen a giant tortoise with the earth on its back,
          but then, no one has ever seen a superstring either. However, the tortoise theory fails to be a good
          scientific theory because it predicts that people should be able to fall off the edge of the world. This
          has not been found to agree with experience, unless that turns out to be the explanation for the people
          who are supposed to have disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle!</p>


          <p>The earliest theoretical attempts to describe and explain the universe involved the idea that events
          and natural phenomena were controlled by spirits with human emotions who acted in a very
          humanlike and unpredictable manner. These spirits inhabited natural objects, such as rivers,
          mountains, and celestial bodies including the sun and moon. They had to be placated and their favor
          sought in order to ensure the fertility of the soil and the rotation of the seasons. Gradually, however, it
          must have been noticed that there were certain regularities: the sun always rose in the east and set in
          the west, whether or not a sacrifice had been made to the sun god. Further, the sun, the moon, and the
          planets followed precise paths across the sky that could be predicted in advance with considerable
          accuracy. The sun and the moon might still be gods, but they were gods who obeyed strict laws,
          apparently without any exceptions, if one discounts stories such as that of the sun stopping for Joshua.</p>

          </figure>


          <p>At first, these regularities and laws were obvious only in astronomy and a few other situations.
          However, as civilization developed, and particularly in the last three hundred years, more and more
          regularities and laws were discovered. The success of these laws led Laplace at the beginning of the
          nineteenth century to postulate scientific determinism; that is, he suggested that there would be a set of
          laws that would determine the evolution of the universe precisely, given its configuration at any one
          time.</p>


          <p>Laplace’s determinism was incomplete in two ways: it did not say how the laws should be chosen,
          and it did not specify the initial configuration of the universe. These were left to God. God would
          choose how the universe began and what laws it obeyed, but He would not intervene in the universe
          once it had started. In effect, God was confined to the areas that nineteenth-century science did not
          understand.</p>


          <p>We now know that Laplace’s hopes of determinism cannot be realized, at least in the terms he had
          in mind. The uncertainty principle of <a href="/glossary#quantum-mechanics" class="one-digit footnote-marker" rel="footnote">quantum mechanics</a> implies that certain pairs of quantities, such
          as the position and velocity of a particle, cannot both be predicted with complete accuracy. Quantum
          mechanics deals with this situation via a class of quantum theories in which particles don’t have
          well-defined positions and velocities but are represented by a wave. These quantum theories are
          deterministic in the sense that they give laws for the evolution of the wave with time. Thus if we
          know the wave at one time, we can calculate it at any other time. The unpredictable, random element
          comes in only when we try to interpret the wave in terms of the positions and velocities of particles.
          But maybe that is our mistake: maybe there are no particle positions and velocities, but only waves. It
          is just that we try to fit the waves to our preconceived ideas of positions and velocities. The resulting
          mismatch is the cause of the apparent unpredictability.</p>


          <p>In effect, we have redefined the task of science to be the discovery of laws that will enable us to
          predict events up to the limits set by the uncertainty principle. The question remains, however: how
          or why were the laws and the initial state of the universe chosen?</p>


          <p>This book has given special prominence to the laws that govern gravity, because it is gravity that
          shapes the large-scale structure of the universe, even though it is the weakest of the four categories of
          forces. The laws of gravity were incompatible with the view, held until quite recently, that the
          universe is unchanging in time: the fact that gravity is always attractive implies that the universe must
          be either expanding or contracting. According to the general theory of relativity, there must have been
          a state of infinite density in the past, the <a href="/glossary#big-bang" class="footnote-marker" rel="footnote">big bang</a>, which would have been an effective beginning of
          time. Similarly, if the whole universe collapsed, there must be another state of infinite density in the
          future, the <a href="/glossary#big-crunch" class="footnote-marker" rel="footnote">big crunch</a>, which would be an end of time. Even if the whole universe did not collapse,
          there would be singularities in any localized regions that collapsed to form <a href="/glossary#black-hole" class="footnote-marker" rel="footnote">black hole</a>. These
          singularities would be an end of time for anyone who fell into the black hole. At the big bang and
          other singularities, all the laws would have broken down, so God would still have had complete
          freedom to choose what happened and how the universe began.</p>


          <p>When we combine quantum mechanics with general relativity, there seems to be a new possibility
          that did not arise before: that space and time together might form a finite, four-dimensional space
          without singularities or boundaries, like the surface of the earth but with more dimensions. It seems
          that this idea could explain many of the observed features of the universe, such as its large-scale
          uniformity and also the smaller-scale departures from homogeneity, including galaxies, stars, and
          even human beings. But if the universe is completely self-contained, with no singularities or
          boundaries, and completely described by a unified theory, that has profound implications for the role
          of God as creator.</p>


          <p>Einstein once asked, "How much choice did God have in constructing the universe?" If the noboundary
          proposal is correct, God had no freedom at all to choose initial conditions. God would, of
          course, still have had the freedom to choose the laws that the universe obeyed. This, however, may
          not really have been all that much of a choice; there may well be only one, or a small number, of
          complete unified theories, such as <a href="/glossary#string-theory" class="footnote-marker" rel="footnote">string theory</a>, that are self-consistent and allow the existence of
          structures as complicated as human beings who can investigate the laws of the universe and ask about
          the nature of God.</p>


          <p>Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it
          that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of
          science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a
          universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing? Is the
          unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence? Or does it need a creator, and if
          so, does He have any other effect on the universe? And who created Him?</p>


          <p>Up to now, most scientists have been too occupied with the development of new theories that
          describe what the universe is to ask why. On the other hand, the people whose business it is to ask
          why, the philosophers, have not been able to keep up with the advance of scientific theories. In the
          eighteenth century, philosophers considered the whole of human knowledge, including science, to be
          their field and discussed questions such as whether the universe had a beginning. However, in the
          nineteenth and twentieth centuries, science became too technical and mathematical for the
          philosophers, or anyone else except a few specialists. Philosophers reduced the scope of their
          inquiries so much that Wittgenstein, the most famous philosopher of the twentieth century, said, "The
          sole remaining task for philosophy is the analysis of language." What a comedown from the great
          tradition of philosophy from Aristotle to Kant!</p>


          <p>If we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by
          everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary
          people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe
          exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason—for then we
          would know the mind of God.
